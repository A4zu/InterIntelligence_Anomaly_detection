# InterIntelligence_Anomaly_detection
# ðŸš€ Anomaly Detection System
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project implements an Anomaly Detection System to identify unusual patterns or outliers in data.
It demonstrates the use of machine learning algorithms such as Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, and Autoencoders.

# Objectives

Data Preparation: Clean and preprocess dataset for anomaly detection.

Model Selection: Apply multiple algorithms (Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, Autoencoders).

Evaluation: Compare models using precision, recall, and F1-score.

Deployment: Integrate into a monitoring framework or application.
